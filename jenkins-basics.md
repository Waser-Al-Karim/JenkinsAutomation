# Jenkins

Jenkins is an open-source automation server which allow us to automate various stages of the software development lifecycle. It is one of the great tools for Continuous Integration (CI) and Continuous Deployment (CD) operations.

# CI/CD for Jenkins

### > Continuous Integration (CI)

1. The Continuous Integration requires developers to merge their code into one shared repository multiple times during each day. 
2. A shared repository receives code integration that undergoes automated testing to identify problems at an early stage. 
3. The system automates build and test execution through Jenkins whenever developers submit code to the repository.

### > Continuous Delivery (CD)

1. Continuous Delivery maintains the codebase in a deployable condition at all times. 
2. The CI process leads to automatic application packaging which prepares the system for deployment at the staging or production level. However, the final deployment step is usually triggered manually.
3. Jenkins automation shortens the processes of the deployment. Which reduces the time and effort needed to prepare a release.

### > Continuous Delivery (CD)

1. Continuous Deployment further extends automation by removing human involvement from the deployment process. 
2. In this approach, every change that passes all tests is automatically deployed to production without any manual intervention.
3. The configuration of Jenkins enables complete automation of workflows to deliver software updates to users at a higher frequency.
